##Introduction:
        The increased threat of Covid-19 throughout the globe affected the market of restaurant severely. To survive this situation, many restaurant enhanced their service to             provide full delivery service to their customer which saved a lot of restaurant from closing. However, the quality of service may vary due to an extensive amount of               reasons. In order to provide best experience to customer, a rating system for driver and restaurant is needed.
        This project is aimed to enhance an existing relational database of a food delivery system with a rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers. With the rating         system, the restaurant will be able to improve their service based on the feedback provided.
